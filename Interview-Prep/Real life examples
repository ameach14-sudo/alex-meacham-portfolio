 As a Technical Analyst II, I troubleshoot PowerChart issues and leverage back-end tools to provide high-quality EHR support for federal and commercial healthcare clients. I’m working toward a career path in client relationship management and strategic support delivery, where I can combine technical expertise with proactive, solutions-focused engagement.
