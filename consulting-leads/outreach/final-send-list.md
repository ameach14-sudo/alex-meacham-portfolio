### EMAIL TO SEND:

```
To: gdemarchi@enflite.com
Subject: Saw your Desktop Support job posting

Hi Guilherme,

I noticed Enflite is hiring for Desktop Support. Before you commit to a full-time salary, I wanted to offer an alternative.

I'm an IT support consultant who helps manufacturing companies:
- Bridge the gap while you search for the right hire
- Build documentation so new techs can onboard faster
- Set up processes that reduce ticket volume

My background is enterprise IT support for federal systems (VA/DOD) - I'm used to documenting everything for compliance.

Would a 15-minute call make sense?

Hi Talor,

I saw Pluckers is hiring a Systems Administrator to support 500+ users across 30+ locations. That's a big role to fill.

While you search for the right person, I could help on a consulting basis:
- Document your IT systems so new hires onboard faster
- Create location-specific troubleshooting guides
- Reduce the ticket load your team is dealing with

My background is enterprise IT support for federal healthcare systems - I've documented processes for much larger environments.

Worth a quick call?
