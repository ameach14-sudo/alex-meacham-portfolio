# Hot Leads - Companies Actively Hiring IT

*These companies are posting IT jobs RIGHT NOW = they have proven need*

## WHY THESE ARE BETTER

Companies posting IT jobs are:
1. **Overwhelmed** - Current staff can't keep up
2. **Growing** - Need documentation for scaling
3. **Open to options** - Might prefer a consultant over a full hire

**Your pitch:** "I saw you're hiring for IT support. Before you commit to a full-time salary, would a part-time consultant help bridge the gap?"

## EMAIL TEMPLATE FOR COMPANIES HIRING

```
Subject: Saw your IT support job posting

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is hiring for IT support. Before you commit to a full-time salary, I wanted to offer an alternative.

I'm an IT support consultant who helps growing companies:
- Bridge the gap while you search for the right hire
- Build documentation so new hires can onboard faster
- Set up processes that reduce ticket volume

My background is enterprise IT support for federal systems - I'm used to documenting everything.

Would a 15-minute call make sense to see if this could help?
