## Email 1: IT Documentation (Best Opener)

**Subject:** Quick IT question

```
Hi [Name],

Does [Company] have documented IT procedures, or is most of the knowledge stuck in people's heads?

I help small businesses create IT documentation that actually gets used - the kind that saves time when someone's out sick or when you're onboarding new staff.

Would a 15-minute call be useful?

## Email 2: Help Desk / Ticket Backlog

**Subject:** Overwhelmed IT inbox?

```
Hi [Name],

Quick question - is your team drowning in IT tickets or repeat questions?

I specialize in fixing that. At my last role, I reduced ticket backlog by 48% and hit 99.6% SLA compliance.

I'm offering part-time consulting to help small businesses get their IT support under control.

Worth a 15-minute chat?

## Email 3: For Law Firms Specifically

**Subject:** IT support for [Firm Name]

```
Hi [Name],

Law firms often run into the same IT problem: critical knowledge lives in one person's head, and when they're out, things break.

I help firms document their IT systems so anyone can handle common issues. My background is enterprise IT support for federal healthcare systems.

Would it help to chat about what this might look like for [Firm Name]?

## Email 4: For Credit Unions / Financial

**Subject:** IT documentation + compliance

```
Hi [Name],

Financial institutions need documented IT procedures - both for efficiency and compliance audits.

I build IT documentation systems for organizations. My background includes federal compliance work (FISMA, HIPAA) and I hold security clearances.

Would a quick call be helpful to discuss [Company]'s documentation needs?

## Follow-Up Email (Send 5 days later if no response)

**Subject:** Re: [Original Subject]

```
Hi [Name],

Just floating this back up in case it got buried.

Happy to chat whenever works - or if this isn't a priority right now, no worries at all.

## Tips

- **Subject lines:** Keep them short and curiosity-driven
- **Length:** Under 100 words - they won't read more
- **Ask:** Always end with a simple yes/no question
- **Personalize:** Use their company name, mention something specific if you can
- **Follow up:** Most replies come from the 2nd or 3rd email, not the first
