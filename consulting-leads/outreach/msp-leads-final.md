# MSP SUBCONTRACTOR LEADS - Logical Fit

## WHY MSPs ARE YOUR BEST TARGET

| Factor | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **They serve multiple clients** | More documentation work than they can handle |
| **They understand documentation value** | Don't need to sell the concept |
| **Project-based work** | Fits your side gig needs |
| **They use subcontractors** | Normal part of their business model |
| **Growing industry** | Austin MSP market is competitive, they need edge |

**Your pitch:** "I do overflow documentation work for MSPs. When your clients need IT procedures written, knowledge bases built, or onboarding docs created - I handle that project."

Hi Stephen,

I'm an IT support consultant in Austin looking for subcontract work with MSPs.

I specialize in:

- Onboarding documentation for new client environments

When your team is at capacity but a client needs documentation work, I can handle that project.

My background is enterprise IT support for federal healthcare systems (VA/DOD). I'm used to creating documentation that passes audits.

Worth a quick conversation?

CC: mike@goliveoak.com
Subject: Documentation partner inquiry

Hi Tate,

Live Oak is growing fast across Texas - congrats on that.

Growth usually means documentation debt: client environments that aren't fully documented, processes that exist in people's heads, onboarding that takes longer than it should.

I do overflow documentation work for MSPs. When you need client environments documented, SOPs written, or knowledge bases built - I handle that project-by-project.

My background is enterprise IT for federal systems. Documentation is what I do.

Would it help to chat?

## WHY THIS MAKES SENSE FOR SIDE WORK

| Factor | MSP Subcontracting | Direct Client Work |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Finding work | MSP sends you projects | You cold call constantly |
| Scope | Clear project deliverables | Scope creep risk |
| Payment | Invoice the MSP | Chase small business owners |
| Scheduling | Project-based, flexible | On-call pressure |
| Repeat work | One MSP = many clients | Start over each time |

**One good MSP relationship = steady side income without constant marketing.**

## WHAT TO SAY IF THEY'RE INTERESTED

**Common questions they'll ask:**

**Q: What do you charge?**
A: "Depends on the project. For a typical client documentation project - documenting network, systems, and procedures - I'd estimate and quote it. Usually $500-2000 depending on complexity. I can give you an exact quote once I understand the scope."

**Q: Do you have examples?**
A: "I can show you samples of documentation I've created. I also have a portfolio showing my background in enterprise IT support with metrics." (Link to your GitHub portfolio)

**Q: How does this work?**
A: "You send me client details, I document their environment and create the deliverables you need, you review and deliver to the client. I invoice you on completion."

**Q: Can you do ongoing work?**
A: "Yes, I can do project-by-project or a monthly retainer for documentation updates. Whatever works for your clients."
