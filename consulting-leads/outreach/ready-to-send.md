## COPY-PASTE EMAILS

### Email to Cesar Nava (Credit Union)

```
To: cnava@atfcu.org
Subject: IT documentation + compliance

Hi Cesar,

Financial institutions need documented IT procedures - both for efficiency and compliance audits.

I build IT documentation systems for organizations. My background includes federal compliance work (FISMA, HIPAA) and I hold security clearances.

Would a quick call be helpful to discuss Austin Telco's documentation needs?

### Email to Katie Nolan (Law Firm)

```
To: knolan@farmerlawpc.com
Subject: IT support for Farmer Law PC

Hi Katie,

Law firms often run into the same IT problem: critical knowledge lives in one person's head, and when they're out, things break.

I help firms document their IT systems so anyone can handle common issues. My background is enterprise IT support for federal healthcare systems.

Would it help to chat about what this might look like for Farmer Law?

Alex Meacham

### Email to Silberman Law (General)

```
To: info@silblawfirm.com
Subject: IT documentation help

Hi,

Does Silberman Law have documented IT procedures, or is most of the knowledge stuck in people's heads?

I help small businesses create IT documentation that actually gets used - the kind that saves time when someone's out sick or when you're onboarding new staff.

Would it help to chat?
